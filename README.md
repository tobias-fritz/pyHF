Implementing the Hartree-Fock method in python


The Hartree-Fock (HF) method is a widely used method in computational chemistry for obtaining approximate solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for a molecular system. The general steps for implementing the HF method can be outlined as follows:

Specify the molecular system, including the number of electrons, the atomic positions, and the type of basis set to be used.
Define the one-electron and two-electron integrals over the basis set. These integrals can be calculated using standard techniques, such as the Gaussian quadrature method.
Solve the HF equations to obtain the molecular orbitals (MOs) and their corresponding energy levels. The HF equations are a set of self-consistent equations that can be solved using iterative methods, such as the power iteration or the Davidson algorithm.
Compute the total energy of the system using the obtained MOs and their energy levels. This can be done using the Hartree-Fock energy expression, which includes contributions from the one-electron and two-electron integrals.
Optional: Perform post-HF calculations, such as perturbation theory or density functional theory, to improve the accuracy of the obtained results.
Here is an example of how this algorithm could be implemented in Python:
